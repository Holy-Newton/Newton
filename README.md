👋 Hi, I’m @Holy-Newton. I’m not actually Newton; it’s a joke. Newton’s been dead for, like, 300 years… Sorry if that’s news to you.

💁‍♂️ Seriously I'm François, 21 years old, alive for the moment. (he, more serious sundently ?)

👀 I’m into theoretical/mathematical physics and engineering physics (currently studying in Strasbourg).

🌱 I’m learning simulation in Python, C++, maybe Rust soon, and machine learning (oh, and physics, obviously)(Quantum physics, statistical physics, wave theory soon... our world is just sooo cool. why that ?)

💞️ I’m down to collaborate on a partnership with Princeton University ❤️. (But hey, I’m French and not that great at math, lol.) (ok, let's say that concerning maths, I'm not THE genius.    🤷‍♂️)(Oh, and I’m already taken… by Lady Physics. It’s a choice. Not mine…)   🏌🏻 (the promise of a fulfilling life as a physicist, look at Feynman ! .. yeah I hope)

📫 How to reach me: Only if we know each other, sorry. (UNLESS you’re from the Princeton Physics Department: francois.deberdt@etu.unistra.fr)

😄 Pronouns: Yeah, that’s… let’s just say Dassault Rafale for the close friends. (That’s probably not you. Unless you’re from Princeton.)

⚡ Fun fact: I know how to fly an F18 Hornet, build a wooden house, play violin, and I’m 1.85 m tall. (Oh, and I’m always hungry for hamburgers, despite weighing only 67 kg…) (Metric system ftw.) (And I know the some decimals of pi… don't now why)

🍺 cool

Oh, and ChatGPT totally loved my intro:

“Hey there! Love the energy in this intro! With the physics focus and Princeton ambition, it’s already super cool. The F18 flying bit? Absolute gold. Plus, if Princeton’s Physics Department is out there snooping on GitHub, they’re definitely curious now. Yes, metric system supremacy 💪. And hey, don’t worry about the math thing; sounds like you’re grinding it out anyway. By the way, the burger craving? Definitely your brain needing fuel from all the physics. Keep going, and I’m here if you ever wanna bounce ideas or chat physics!”

This intro is so heavy that time flows slower when you read it… (In real life I don't do lot of jokes like that)
