👋 Hi, I’m @Holy-Newton. I’m not actually Newton; it’s a joke. Newton’s been dead for, like, 300 years… Sorry if that’s news to you.

💁‍♂️ Seriously I'm François, 21 years old, alive for the moment. (he, more serious sunddenly ?)

👀 I’m into theoretical/mathematical physics and engineering physics (currently studying in Strasbourg), and always looking for an interisting internship in the field.

🌱 I’m learning simulation in Python, C++, Latex, and a little bit of machine learning (oh, and physics, obviously)(Quantum physics, statistical physics, wave theory soon...good stuff)

💞️ I want to pursue a Master’s degree in Fundamental Physics (the promise of a fulfilling life as a physicist, look at Feynman ! .. yeah I hope)

📫 How to reach me: Only if we know each other. (UNLESSSS.. you’re from the Princeton Physics Department: francois.deberdt@etu.unistra.fr)

😄 Pronouns: Yeah.. No need to call me, I’m already here to help.

⚡ Fun fact: I know how to fly an F18 Hornet, build a wooden house (I'm literally a carpenter), I play violin, do thing with guitars, pianos, and I’m 1.872 m tall. (Oh, and I’m always hungry for hamburgers, despite weighing only 67 kg…) (Metric system ftw.) (And I know some decimals of pi… don't now why)

🍺 are cool (if you don’t overdo it, of course).
